# RSVP

The first commit here is the result of a [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/dom-scripting-by-example) project, creating an app to handle event invites. Users can enter, edit, and remove names, and tag invitees as 'Confirmed' (via a checkbox). Further, they can filter the invitees group to show only those who have confirmed.

## Next steps

I am developing this app further, by including (at least) the following features:

- Prevent duplicate names.
- Checkbox should read 'Confirm' when unchecked and 'Confirmed' when checked.
- Add an option for 'Not coming'.
- When filtered, the 'Confirmed' checkbox still shows â€” remove this, it's unnecessary at this point.
- Alphabetise confirmed list.
- Add option to show _unconfirmed_ and _not coming_ lists.
- Use local storage.
